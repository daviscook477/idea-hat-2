# idea-hat-2
This is the version 2 of the idea hat project. This is a complete remake!
The remake includes a rewrite of the interface to the firebase that is much stronger.
There are now permissions systems that allow for validating permissions based on the current user.
This is done with the idea-perm directive. The ui has been rewritten.
Support has been added for user account settings locally and on the firebase!
